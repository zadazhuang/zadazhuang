                As a postgraduate student from Hong Kong Baptist University, majoring in Communication, I have a solid understanding
                of marketing and communications. My experience in content creation and project management has allowed me to work on
                multiple projects simultaneously and perform well under pressure. I am a team player, proactive in facing challenges, and
                self-motivated to learn new things. With my passion and perseverance, I am ready to contribute my skills and knowledge in the
                marketing field and gain valuable hands-on experience through day-to-day tasks.
